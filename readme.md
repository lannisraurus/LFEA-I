# Overview

This repository comprises of data collected and treated by me, Duarte Tavares, and Gabriel Neto, for our course in Advanced Experimental Physics I, as part of the degree of Engineering Physics, IST, second year.

There is plenty of experimental data in the folder *Raw Lab Data* to run experiments on, as well as plenty of data treatment and visualization snippets inside the *Analysis Programmes* folder.

The code is far from organized, however it serves as an example use of the ROOT library, especially when it comes to applying transformations to data sets, displaying graphs, and running function fits.
